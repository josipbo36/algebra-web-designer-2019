## Assignment

You are tasked with designing a web shop for a fashion brand.

Your first assignment is to design a product card to display within a grid or list of products.

The following product information is available:

- image;
- name;
- price;
- category.

A product can have one of four states at any time:

- available for purchase;
- on promotional discount;
- out of stock;
- coming soon.

Using the provided information structure, design a product card for use on mobile phones.

Write a short paragraph explaining your design and the choices you made in the design process. Provide arguments for and against design choices.

### Deliverables

To complete the assignment, deliver a Figma project file containing the following:

- one product card design in the "available for purchase" state;
- one product card design in the "on promotional discount" state;
- one product card design in the "out of stock" state;
- one product card design in the "coming soon" state.

### Tips, tricks, and notes

- Limit your canvas size to match a smaller mobile phone, such as the iPhone SE (320 x 568 px) and resize the canvas vertically as necessary
- Focus on a specific field in fashion (e.g. footwear) and research how brands with the same focus (e.g. Nike, Adidas) tackle this problem on their web shops
- Use real-world product information to experience real-world problems presenting that information
